Produce four markdown tables: Total Customer LTV, Customer LTV by Plan, Customer LTV by Industry, Customer LTV by Channel. Use initial subscription and plan type to assign customers. Use LTV formula LTV = (Average Revenue per User / Churn Rate) × Profit Margin. Calculate churn rate as churned_customers / customers_at_start. If churn=0 assume 5 years customer lifetime (toggleable). Create CAC-to-LTV analysis by acquisition channel. Profit per user should only include profit generated from Jan 2023 to Dec 2023 from users who ordered during those dates. Customers at start are those with active subscriptions in Jan 2023; churned customers should be customers who were active subscribers between Jan and Dec 2023 and churned during that period; exclude customers who joined after Jan 2023 from churn numerator.","task_result_name":"ltv_by_segments_plan","steps":{"1":{"step_number":1,"description":"Clarify assumptions, list open questions, and get user confirmation before any data processing.","instructions":"Create a confirmation document at /work/01_clarify_and_confirm.md that explicitly lists the assumptions and asks the user to confirm or change them.

Confirm.\n- Profit margin calculation: Profit_Margin = total_profit_2023 / total_revenue_2023 for each cohort (fraction).
